# PolyDessin

## About the App

PolyDessin is an online-based graphics editor. The app allows you to use classic `MS Paint` tools such as pen, brush, spray, stamp, selection and more to draw anything you'd like. You can also export your drawings as JPEG, PNG or SVG, or even send them by email. Other major features include saving your drawings to a public gallery, loading other users' public drawings and even continuing drawings you might have forgotten to save.
